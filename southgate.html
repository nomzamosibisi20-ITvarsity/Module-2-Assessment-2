					<h3>SOUTHGATE MALL SUPERETTE</h3>
					<p>With its opening in 1990, Southgate Mall was the first cosmopolitan regional shopping centre in the South of Jozi that needed to meet the needs of its rapidly changing market. But almost from day one, Southgate was not the centre it was predicted to be, hailed as the south's answer to the burgeoning shopping industry that saw centres opening all over Johannesburg.</p> 

<p>Situated in the hub of southern suburbia, at the Gateway to Soweto - which remains the most dynamic former township area in the country. The mall is strategically positioned opposite its convenience centre - the Southgate Value Market which is 19950m² in size. Jointly, these centres have MORE to offer the communities of southern suburbia; with an array of new retailers that have been injected into the diverse tenant mix.</p>

<p>Southgate Mall does not only provide great shopping, but includes a choice of great eateries and take-aways, designated exhibitions facilities occasionally utilized by FMCG brand launches and promotions. Truly a great place to enjoy your day! The centre is anchored by prominent brands such as areas Woolworths, Dis-Chem, Pick ‘n Pay, Checkers, Game with Foodco, Edgars, Ster Kinekor and is wholly owned by Pareto Limited. As such, Southgate's sister centres include big names such as Menyln Shopping Centre, The Pavilion, Westgate Shopping Centre, Mimosa Mall and Tyger Valley.</p>
