					<h3>CAPE UNION MART</h3>
					<p>The history of Cape Union Mart dates back to 1933 when the late Philip Krawitz, grandfather of the current Chairman, founded the business on the corner of Corporation and Mostert Street in Cape Town. Cape Union Mart originated as an army and navy store and became famous for its broad product range. Back then, this one Cape Union Mart shop was sandwiched between two of South Africas largest retailers, Woolworths and OK Bazaars, we realised that it had to offer something different. Apart from an extensive range of merchandise, the store became known as the friendly store and focused on building unique relationships with its customers.</p>
                    
                    <p>During the war years, Cape Union Mart supplied visiting troops with some of the luxuries and necessities associated with the military. Passing whaling ships and foreign fishermen were also catered for with a unique array of merchandise from around the world. In the post-war years, the company grew and prospered under Arthur Krawitz who took over the business from his father in the late 1940s. The company became famous for non-seasonal merchandise and specialised in selling summer clothing to people touring overseas in winter and vice versa. Cape Union Mart was the first importer of many famous products such as Levi Jeans, Hong Kong anoraks, Norwegian socks and Gore-Tex foul weather clothing.</p>
