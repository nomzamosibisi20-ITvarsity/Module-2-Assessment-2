					<h3>PANAROTTIS</h3>
					<p>Enjoy a bite of Panarottis’ mouth-watering pizzas and pastas in a family-friendly Italian-inspired restaurant. They are passionate about families and delicious food made from the finest ingredients.</p>

<p>Panarottis Pizza Pasta was founded by Spur Corporation in December 1990. Applying the same principles that made Spur Steak Ranches a household name, Panarottis soon capitalised on the growing popularity of pizza and pasta, as well as its focus Big on Family. Big on Pizza.</p>

<p>Passion and quality come first in everything Panarottis does. Quality is a key cornerstone of the brand, along with the superb Italian-style meals they love to prepare. They only use the finest selection of award-winning ingredients – imported olive oils, Balsamic vinegar, Parmesan cheese and Danish feta. Panarottis pizzas are made from the finest imported Italian flour and their pastas are 100% Durum wheat.</p>

<p>In 2017, Panarottis Wood-fired Pizza was launched, ushering in a delicious new wood-fired element to our already mouth-watering pizzas and scrumptious pastas. Offering the same fantastic quality and meals that Panarottis Pizza Pasta customers have come to love, Panarottis Wood-fired differs in that the pizzas are individually and expertly baked in a wood-fired oven, to give them a deliciously unique and authentic flavour.</p>

<p>Panarottis is famous for its value for money meals like the Monsterito Pizza, and weekday specials, including Eat as much pizza as you like Thursdays and daily Breakfast Specials.</p>

                    <p>With Panarottis Rewards, customers are able to earn 5% of the value of their bill back in points, which they can redeem for Panarottis vouchers. Being part of the Rewards programme also allows customers entry into exclusive competitions, promotions and access to vouchers.</p>

<p>Drawing on the family-friendly environment, Panarottis also offers a range of delicious menu items for kids to enjoy. The Dough it Yourself tray allows kids to get creative and make their own pizza the Panarottis way, with their choice of toppings. Select Panarottis restaurants also offer a Kid’s Play Area, which includes PlayStations to keep kids entertained for hours and makes the ideal venue for kids’ parties.</p>

<p>Buon appetito!</p>
