					<h3>MUGG & BEAN</h3>
					<p>In the early 90’s, Ben Filmalter and his wife Judi discovered a little coffee shop on the South Side in Chicago. It was unique as it prided itself on its spirit of generosity.</p>

<p>With this in mind, Ben went home and opened the first Mugg & Bean in 1996 at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town.</p>

<p>From the beginning Mugg & Bean prided itself on generous portions and we were amongst the first restaurants in South Africa to serve Bottomless Coffee.</p>

<p>But Ben wanted more than just a restaurant. He wanted a place where people arrived as customers and left as friends.</p>

<p>This seed of generosity sprouted and our history began writing itself. In less than 7 years Mugg & Bean had grown to over 80 restaurants nation wide. Today you can find us in 220 locations across Africa.</p>

<p>Mugg & Bean is now the place where you are always welcome, where you always get more and more. For this we raise our bottomless mugs to Ben, a man who will always be remembered as Mr Generosity.</p>
