					<h3>JOHN DORYS</h3>
					<p>John Dory’s specialises in great quality sustainable seafood, sushi and grills, in a fun and family-friendly environment.</p>

<p>In November 2004, the Spur Corporation acquired a 60% shareholding in John Dory’s Fish, Grill & Sushi – KwaZulu-Natal based franchise comprising seven outlets. Founded eight years earlier as a predominantly seafood restaurant, John Dory’s has a distinctly Mediterranean culture and charisma. A further 5% interest was purchased in October 2006, and the remaining 35% was acquired on 25 January 2012, with the group now owning 100% of the business.</p>

<p>Over the years, John Dory’s has incorporated many unique menu items at very affordable prices. In conjunction with this, the brand continuously runs in-house and national promotions.</p>

<p>John Dory’s is committed to sustainable business practice through their Eco Voyage sustainability programme. In collaboration with Spur Corporation, they are making a concerted effort to ensure our Environmental Sustainability Policy is a living reality in their restaurants.</p>

<p>The brand takes pride in their relationship with the Southern African Sustainable Seafood Initiative (SASSI), realising how vital responsible fishing practices are to the depleted ocean resources. As a member, John Dory’s is committed to delivering sustainable seafood from SASSI’s approved “Green” list, and undertakes to purchase products from reputable suppliers – all of which are able to trace the product back to its source – they therefore have certain “licensed” products that have to be bought by their franchisees. They also undertake not to stock items on the endangered or “Red” list and do not promote items on the “orange” list.</p>

<p>The John Dory’s children’s menu includes tasty options for little ones that will not manage the generous adult portions. Most of the restaurants have kids’ play facilities featuring modular PlayStations and a fun play area where kids can enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>Excellent service remains one of John Dory’s trademarks and brand pillars, with all staff – waitrons, managers, chefs – going the extra mile to ensure customers consistently receive the best possible experience while dining.</p>

<p>John Dory’s currently boasts a national footprint and also has restaurants in Namibia and Zambia.</p>

<p>With John’s Club, customers are able to earn 5% of the value of their bill back in points, which they can redeem for John Dory’s vouchers. Being part of the John’s Club programme also allows customers entry into exclusive competitions, promotions and access to vouchers.</p>

<p>So what is it that makes John Dory’s so successful? Its recipe to success lies in their authentic fish, grill and sushi offerings at excellent value, a big dollop of fun and family atmosphere stirred together with vibrant ambience, makes everyone love John Dory’s.</p>
