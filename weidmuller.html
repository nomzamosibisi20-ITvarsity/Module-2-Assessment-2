					<h3>WEIDMULLER</h3>
					<p>Together with our customers, we shape the digital transformation - with products, solutions and services for Smart Industrial Connectivity and the Industrial Internet of Things</p>
                    
                    <p>Be it automobile manufacturing, electricity production or water management - hardly any of today’s industries can do without electronics and electrical connectivity. In this internationalised, technologically changing world, the complexity of requirements is rapidly increasing due to the emergence of new markets. New, more varied challenges have to be overcome, and the solutions to them will not be found in high-tech products alone. Connectivity is the key, whether it involves power, signals and data, demands and solutions or theory and practice. Industrial Connectivity needs connections. And that’s precisely what we stand for.</p>
                    
                    <p>Did you know that Weidmüller has stood for Service, Competence and Reliability since 1850? Or that we are represented in 80 countries all around the world? It is important for us that you not only know our products and solutions but that you also know our values, our roots and our culture. Because it is these connections that make us into your Industrial Connectivity partner.</p>
