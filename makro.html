					<h3>MAKRO</h3>
					<p>Makro is an international brand of warehouse clubs, also called cash and carries. Ownership of the worldwide chain of stores is split between two companies: Metro AG in Europe and SHV Holdings in Latin America. SHV opened the first Makro in Amsterdam in 1968. In the following years more stores opened in the Netherlands and several other European countries and, in 1971, South Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s Makro extended its business to the Americas and Asia. Makro had also expanded to the United States in the mid-1980s. In 1989, Kmart bought the US locations, and converted most of them to Pace Warehouse in 1990. The Asian stores were also eventually sold out to various firms and are no longer banded "Makro". In 1998, owner SHV Holdings sold the Makro stores in Europe to Metro AG.</p>
                    
                    <p>Makro has evolved in the retail space from a stalwart warehouse chain to now being able to offer customers a convenient online shopping hub. Makro offers food, the latest electronics, houseware, camping and outdoor equipment and even liquor.</p>

<p>A total of 22 Makro stores trade in South Africa, bringing convenience and affordability to local households and businesses. With the ecommerce addition to our digital offering, customers can now enjoy Makroâ€™s deals and value-added services across a broader reach of locations.</p>

<p>Our extensive online shopping range includes the majority of items you would expect to find in any Makro store and carries with it the same ethos we have always maintained. We operate under a low cost/ low margin trading philosophy, enabling us to deliver quality merchandise at competitive prices.</p>
