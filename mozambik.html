					<h3>MO-ZAM-BIK</h3>
                    <p>With its roots firmly set in passion and its flavours unapologetically Afro Porto, the Mozambik restaurant group is fast becoming one of South Africaâ€™s leading dining brands. From its launch as a single store in Ballito, Kwa-Zulu Natal circa 15 years ago, the brand has seen rapid growth over the past half-decade, now totaling 15 stores nationally. Later in 2019, the Mozambik brand will also expand north of the Limpopo with its first international store scheduled to open in Lusaka.</p>

<p>With several sites currently being evaluated, the Mozambik brand is set to continue on its upward trajectory.</p>
